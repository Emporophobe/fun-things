I don't know, what do you want to do?

## Inspiration
We're often bored and not very decisive. This app lets us delegate our entertainment decisions to cold hard algorithms to optimize fun and eliminate floundering.
## What it does
We have a very simple frontend where you input a handful of parameters, like how many people want to participate and maximum cost per person. Behind the scenes, though, we harnessed a number of APIs and ~~Excel files~~ hand-crafted, small batch, artisan databases to filter through all the possible activities and return one, single thing, which you are then obligated to do.
## How it works
